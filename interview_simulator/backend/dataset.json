As I mainly wrote copy for eCommerce sites, I would always be very busy and in demand around holiday periods. To deal with these ongoing workloads and to ensure that I met every deadline, I had a set of practices in place and tools I used to help me organize my time. For example, I had a structured calendar where I would set alerts and work reminders to keep me on track with individual assignments.

There were schedule clashes and an urgent need to issue invoices far quicker than our usual timelines. Last year, I was the only team leader so a lot of the relationship management sat with me. I invested time right at the start of the year talking to clients, to encourage them to place their orders as soon as possible. This spurred them to think about their training needs and spare budget earlier than they would otherwise have done. I was very clear that our standard time to issue invoices was 28 days, to manage their expectations. This also minimized the chance of them unnecessarily pressuring my team members later.
